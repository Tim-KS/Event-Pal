## User Story

AS a user 
I WANT to be able to find other people going to a concert
I WANT to be able to select the people I would like to attend the concert with
SO THAT I can organise to meet them, communicate with them and organise to attend as a group
As a user 
I WANT to be able to write reviews and comments
SO THAT other users can share my views on the concert or the band

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
